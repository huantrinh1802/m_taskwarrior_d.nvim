# Mark Taskwarrior Down in Neovim

## Description

The plugin allow you to view, add, edit, and complete tasks without ever leaving the comfort of Neovim text
The goals of this plugin are:

- Be a simple tool without obstructing the view of the document
- Improve the workflow of task management in Markdown files
- Not reinvent the wheel of the way Taskwarrior manages tasks

## Features

- [x] Injected and concealed Taskwarrior task
- [x] Detect task (checkbox) in Markdown or similar files and register the task into Taskwarrior
  - [x] Work with Markdown with ( - [ ])
  - [ ] Docstring in Python
  - [ ] JSDoc in JavaScript
- [x] Bidirectionally manage the task
- [>] Best effort to add contexts to the tasks:
  - [ ] Use treesitter for better capturing contexts
  - [x] Tags
  - [x] Dependencies
    - [x] Detect nested subtasks and update related tasks
    - [x] Render dependencies with query view
  - [x] Project
- [x] View individual task on hover
- [x] Edit task detail within Neovim (through nui.nvim)
- [x] `Query View` similar to `dateview` in Obsidian or `Viewport` in Taskwiki
- [x] Virtual text for due and scheduled tasks

## Maybe Feature

- Interface for displaying Taskwarrior reports
- Query tasks to other pages similar to viewport in `taskwiki` or `dateview` in Obsidian
- Better UI for advance Taskwarrior usage such as overdue, waiting, and more

## Out of scope

- UI for editing task (I am reusing `task {id} edit`)

## Dependencies

- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) (pre3.0) (hard required)
  - Have not tested v3.0 but it may have a breaking change due to its move to SQLite as the main storage engine
- [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)
  - For all UIs in the plugin

## Work Well With

- [mkdnflow.nvim](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim)
  - This plugin provides comprehensive utilities for Markdown files
  - Caveat: you need to disable/not use toggle checkbox from this plugin
- [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/tree/main)
  - If you use Obsidian for note taking, this plugin is highly recommended
  - This plugin provides some nice concealment and utilities for Obsidian
- [markdown.nvim](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/markdown.nvim)
  - Plugin to improve viewing Markdown files in Neovim
  - Tips: if you use `markdown.nvim` and `obsidan.nvim`, you should disable `obsidian.nvim`'s UI configurations

## Similar To

- [taskwiki](https://github.com/tools-life/taskwiki)
  - This plugin provides better utilities for managing tasks in Markdown files with Taskwarrior
  - Reasons I decided not to use this plugin:
    - Rely on [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), which has wonky interactions with `obsidian.nvim` and `mkdnflow.nvim` (due to special filetype `vimwiki`)
    - Disclaimer: there may be a way to configure to make Vimwiki and markdown plugins to work together but I decided to write m_taskwarrior_d.nvim

## Installation

```lua
{
    "huantrinh1802/m_taskwarrior_d.nvim",
    version = "*",
    dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
    config = function()
    -- Require
      require("m_taskwarrior_d").setup()
    -- Optional
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>te", "<cmd>TWEditTask<cr>", { desc = "TaskWarrior Edit", noremap = true, silent = true })
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>tv", "<cmd>TWView<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>tu", "<cmd>TWUpdateCurrent<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>ts", "<cmd>TWSyncTasks<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
        "n",
        "<c-space>",
        "<cmd>TWToggle<cr>",
        { silent = true }
      )
    -- Be caution: it may be slow to open large files, because it scan the whole buffer
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufEnter", "BufWritePost" }, {
        group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("TWTask", { clear = true }),
        pattern = "*.md,*.markdown", -- Pattern to match Markdown files
        callback = function()
          vim.cmd('TWSyncTasks')
        end,
      })
    end,
  },
```

## Usage

- Default configurations:

```lua
{
  -- The order of toggling task statuses
  task_statuses = { " ", ">", "x", "~" },
  -- The mapping between status and symbol in checkbox
  status_map = { [" "] = "pending", [">"] = "active", ["x"] = "completed", ["~"] = "deleted" },
  -- The checkbox prefix and suffix
  checkbox_prefix = "[",
  checkbox_suffix = "]",
  -- The default list symbol
  default_list_symbol = "-",
  -- Comments pattern prefix and suffix
  -- This is extremely useful for viewing the note in any Makrdown previewers (i.e. Obsidian app) if you set   
  -- - comment_prefix = "<!--",
  -- - comment_suffix = "-->",
  comment_prefix = "",
  comment_suffix = "",
  -- More configurations will be added in the future
}
```

### Statuses

- `pending`: corresponding to `pending` status
- `active`: has `active` attribute 
- `completed`: corresponding to `completed` status
- `deleted`: corresponding to `deleted` status

If you are using `obsidian.nvim`, you can use the following configuration:

```lua
{
  ui = {
    checkboxes = {
      [" "] = { char = "󰄱", hl_group = "ObsidianTodo" },
      ["x"] = { char = "", hl_group = "ObsidianDone" },
      [">"] = { char = "", hl_group = "ObsidianRightArrow" },
      ["~"] = { char = "󰰱", hl_group = "ObsidianTilde" },
               },
    hl_groups = {
      ObsidianTodo = { bold = true, fg = "#f78c6c" },
      ObsidianDone = { bold = true, fg = "#89ddff" },
      ObsidianRightArrow = { bold = true, fg = "#f78c6c" },
      ObsidianTilde = { bold = true, fg = "#ff5370" },
      ObsidianBullet = { bold = true, fg = "#89ddff" },
      ObsidianRefText = { underline = true, fg = "#008080" },
      ObsidianExtLinkIcon = { fg = "#008080" },
      ObsidianTag = { italic = true, fg = "#89ddff" },
      ObsidianHighlightText = { bg = "#75662e" },
    },
  },
}
```

If you are using `markdown.nvim`, you can set the following configuration:

```lua
  {
    "MeanderingProgrammer/markdown.nvim",
    name = "render-markdown", -- Only needed if you have another plugin named markdown.nvim
    dependencies = { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter" },
    config = function()
      require("render-markdown").setup({
        checkbox = {
          enabled = true,
          checked = {
            -- Replaces '[x]' of 'task_list_marker_checked'
            icon = " ",
            -- Highligh for the checked icon
            highlight = "RenderMarkdownChecked",
          },
          custom = {
            started = { raw = "[>]", rendered = " ", highlight = "@markup.raw" },
            deleted = { raw = "[~]", rendered = " ", highlight = "@markup.raw" },
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
```

### Commands

- `:TWToggle`: toggle status of task
  - If the task is registered in Taskwarrior, it also checks the parent task (if any) to determine the final status and apply it. The logic is as follows:
    - If there are any started tasks, it returns `active`.
    - If there are pending tasks but no started tasks, it returns `pending`.
    - If there are completed tasks, it returns `completed`.
    - If they are all deleted tasks, it returns `deleted`.
    - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns "unknown" (or any other default value).
- `:TWSyncTasks`: traverse the current buffer and sync all tasks
  - There are a few scenarios, that may happen:
    - If the task is not in Taskwarrior, and doesn't have UUID, it will add the task to Taskwarrior and add the UUID to the buffer
    - If the task is not in Taskwarrior, but have UUID in the follow format `$id{uuid}` then it will add the task to TaskWarrior and update the UUID
    - If the task is in Taskwarrior:
      - If nothing changes, nothing get updated
      - If the descriptions are different, it will update the description in the buffer as I prefer Taskwarrior to be source of truth
  - If any headers have QueryView, the tasks in the scope of the headers (surrounded by 2 empty lines, according to Markdown) will be modified with such query, except for `status:*`.
    - For example,

    ```markdown
      # Project pending tasks for project A $query{status:pending project:A}
    ```

    - Any tasks under the header will be assigned to project A
- `:TWSyncCurrent`: similar to `TWSyncTasks` but only sync the current task. Work with normal and visual mode
- `:TWSyncBulk`: similar to `TWSyncTasks` but only sync the selected tasks in visual mode
- `:TWUpdateCurrent`: quickly update the description of the task so you don't have to use the edit command
- `:TWEditTask`: toggle a float window, which can edit the task.
  - Using the `task {id} edit` behind the scene
  - It will update the description in the buffer if you edited it in the popup
- `:TWView`: a quick view of more details of the task
  - It is focusable so you can copy texts from their
  - It will be dismissed once the cursor moves or reenter the buffer
- `:TWRunWithCurrent`: extract the current UUID, and ask user for input. Run the command as follow `!task {uuid} {user input}`
- `:TWRun`: there are two ways to use this command:
  - `TWRun` without any arguments, an input component will appear and ask for your command
    - Enter empty again, it will run `task`
  - `TWRun {command}`
    - Run the command as follow `task {user input}`
      - If the command has `add`, `del`, `mod` or `purge`, the output will print out only
      - Otherwise, the output will be put into a float, focusable window under the cursor. It is dismissed once the cursor moves or reenter the buffer
- `:TWFocusFloat`: switch the focus to a floating window (or hover, triggered by `TWView`, `TWRunWithCurrent`, and `TWRun`).
- `:TWEditSavedQueries`: display a buffer with list of saved queries. Each query should be a valid Taskwarrior query that can be run with `task {query}`
  - Each query can be edited and saved as you could with any buffer
  - The format is `[name of the query] | [filters] | [report]`, don't include `[` and `]` in your actual query
  - `q` or `:q` will close thu buffer without saving any changes
  - `:wq` or `w` will save and close the buffer
  - The file is saved in `vim.fn.stdpath("data").."m_taskwarrior_d.nvim"`
- `:TWSavedQueries`: will prompt a menu with the list of all saved queries, after an item is selected, a floating window will open with the output of `task {query}`
- `:TWRunBulk`: similar to `TWRun`, but run commands on selected tasks in visual mode
- `:TWQueryTasks`: similar to `taskwiki`'s viewport, render the output of the `task {query}` as the list of tasks
  - Nested tasks are supported
  - In-sync with where it is first created
- `:TWBufQueryTasks`: similar to `TWQueryTasks`, but this will scan the current buffer and run all the queries in the current buffer
- `:TWTaskScratch`: prompt a menu with the list of all saved queries, after an item is selected, a split window will open and render out the tasks of the selected query
  - What it does is open a temporary file in `vim.fn.stdpath("data").."/m_taskwarrior_d.md"`, append the selected query and run `TWQueryTasks` on it
  - There are two additional commands to use with the scratch window:
    - `:TWScratchShow`: to show the hidden scratch window
    - `:TWScratchHide`: to hide the scratch window
- `:TWShowDueOrScheduled`: display due or scheduled tasks as virtual text end of line
- `:TWShowDueOrScheduledCurrent`: display due or scheduled tasks as virtual text end of line for current line


### Task Dependencies

- Nested checkboxes are depended on the parent checkbox

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1 # Has 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 as dependencies $id{d4452942-ac6e-46c6-b110-001ea731c676}
  - [ ] Task 1.1 # Has none $id{53389315-5975-4db9-a796-1cd2514e1be1}
  - [ ] Task 1.2 # Has 1.2.1 as dependency $id{ea843624-37c0-429c-89c6-19f661149668}
    - [ ] Task 1.2.1 $id{792e57a6-ea55-4c9e-ab32-9e840d66088d}
```

### QueryView

```markdown
# Tasks that are in pending of project A $query{status:pending project:A}
```
